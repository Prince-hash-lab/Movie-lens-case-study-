# SUMMARY
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the University of Minnesota. The researchers of this group are involved in many research projects related to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and recommender systems. Here, we ask you to perform the analysis using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique. In particular, we want you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict the survivors of the tragedy.

	* 50:  "50-55"
	* 56:  "56+"

- Occupation is chosen from the following choices:

	*  0:  "other" or not specified
	*  1:  "academic/educator"
	*  2:  "artist"
	*  3:  "clerical/admin"
	*  4:  "college/grad student"
	*  5:  "customer service"
	*  6:  "doctor/health care"
	*  7:  "executive/managerial"
	*  8:  "farmer"
	*  9:  "homemaker"
	* 10:  "K-12 student"
	* 11:  "lawyer"
	* 12:  "programmer"
	* 13:  "retired"
	* 14:  "sales/marketing"
	* 15:  "scientist"
	* 16:  "self-employed"
	* 17:  "technician/engineer"
	* 18:  "tradesman/craftsman"
	* 19:  "unemployed"
	* 20:  "writer"

# MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

Movie information is in the file "movies.dat" and is in the following
format:

MovieID::Title::Genres

- Titles are identical to titles provided by the IMDB (including
year of release)
- Genres are pipe-separated and are selected from the following genres:

	* Action
	* Adventure
	* Animation
	* Children's
	* Comedy
	* Crime
	* Documentary
	* Drama
	* Fantasy
	* Film-Noir

	* War
	* Western

- Some MovieIDs do not correspond to a movie due to accidental duplicate
entries and/or test entries
- Movies are mostly entered by hand, so errors and inconsistencies may exist

Tasks to Be Performed
